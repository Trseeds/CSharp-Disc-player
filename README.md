CSharp Disc Player is a simple .net 3.1 CD player, unfortunately, it only works on Windows, and as far as my testing suggests, only as far back as Windows 10, this will be rectified in later versions.
This is my first project in C#, it's mostly just serving to get me used to the language.
CSDP currently runs in the terminal, but eventually it will come with a GUI.
